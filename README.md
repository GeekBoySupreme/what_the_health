# What the Health

In the initial days of Covid, there was a lot of hue and uproar around the data safety and privacy policies of multiple covid tracker apps across the world, more so in India where Aarogya Setu became a bone of contention.<br/>
While data sharing is necessary for public health officials, the question was, how do we make this easier for the public to share info without feeling like they were coerced into it, and making this fun.
<br/>
What the Health tries to add a level of transparency and old school nostalgia by letting people share their health data in the form of a gamified quiz, where they get to share Spotify song/playlist links with others who use the platform.
